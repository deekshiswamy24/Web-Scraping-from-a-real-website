# Web Scraping from a real website
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites and web pages programmatically. It involves using specialized software or libraries to navigate through the HTML structure of a website, locate specific elements, and extract relevant information for analysis or storage.
 
 Libraries used to perform webscraping:

 Beautiful Soup:Beautiful Soup is a Python library that makes parsing HTML and XML documents effortless. It provides a simple and intuitive interface to navigate the HTML structure and extract data from web pages.
 
 Requests: Requests is a powerful Python library for making HTTP requests to fetch data from URLs. It allows you to send GET, POST, and other types of requests and receive responses from web servers. Requests make it easy to retrieve web page content, API data, or any other information from the web.

 In this project, we exctrated data from a real website by using beautifulSoup and Requests libraries and we created a pandas data frame to store the extracted data and we created a file named companies.csv from the website.
